### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a school of code graduate looking for my first role in the tech industry! I have come from many interesting jobs and roles, starting by gaining a degree in Bsc Economics and working in the corporate world as an ad ops executive to running my own screen printing business. I also worked as a carpenter and furniture maker and to expand my mind (and save my body from injury) I decided to take the leap from making in the physical world to making in the digital world, joining the School of Code to achieve this! <br/>

During my life of work I've picked up many skills which have been neccessary in day to day life: <br/>
- I consider myself to be a great communicator as I've had experience breaking down technical and complicated subjects into easily explainable language. <br/>
- Problem solving, finding the easiest solutions and making sure not to overcomplicate the method to achieve the outome.<br/>
- I'm not afraid to take risks and push myself out of the comfort zone.<br/>
- I love change and won't shy away from shaking things up if there's another way to do it (however I'm adaptable and won't try to change things for the sake of it).<br/>
- I gain energy from building ideas with people and creating something together.<br/>
- I can be a leader who focuses on building connections with people to bring out their best ideas, including everyone by making psychological safety a priority. <br/>
- Familiar with the agile working style.

I've learned to use the following for full stack development:<br/>
