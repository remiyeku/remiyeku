## Hi I'm Anthony ðŸ‘‹

As a junior Javascript developer, I bring a diverse range of achievements and skills that make me a
well-rounded and capable professional. I gained a strong background in technical skills by practicing
engineering at the Smallpiece Trust and restoration work which also gave me a solid foundation in
problem-solving and analytical thinking. Beyond my technical expertise, I have demonstrated
leadership abilities as a school prefect, showcasing my ability to take responsibility and manage
tasks effectively.Additionally, I have had the opportunity to perform on stage at the Globe Theatre
as part of a summer school, highlighting my creativity and confidence in public speaking and my
ability to take on multiple roles. <br/> <br/>
My passion for the arts extends to painting, drawing, and photography; showing a keen design eye. I
have organized and marketed exhibitions to showcase my work, honing my skills in project
management, marketing and event organising. I also have experience in music, having performed on
stage multiple times and achieved a Grade 5 Piano certification. This shows further an ability to
perform in team settings, harmonising with them. Music study has also been proven to improve
pattern recognition and creative thinking. <br/> <br/>
As a full stack developer, I possess a good understanding of web development principles and
technologies however I understand I have lots to learn. My knowledge is complemented by a usercentered design approach, ensuring that I prioritize the needs and experiences of users throughout
the development process. Overall, my achievements and soft skills make me a well-rounded junior
developer, ready to contribute to dynamic and innovative projects. I am dedicated continuously
improving my abilities in order to excel in the field of software development<br/>

### During my life of work I've picked up many skills which have been neccessary in the day to day: <br/>
- I consider myself to be a great communicator as I've had experience breaking down technical and complicated subjects into easily explainable language. <br/>
- Problem solving, finding the easiest solutions and making sure not to overcomplicate the method to achieve the outome.<br/>
- I'm not afraid to take risks and push myself out of the comfort zone.<br/>
- I love change and won't shy away from shaking things up if there's another way to do it (however I'm adaptable and won't try to change things for the sake of it).<br/>
- I gain energy from building ideas with people and creating something together.<br/>
- I can be a leader who focuses on building connections with people to bring out their best ideas, including everyone by making psychological safety a priority. <br/>
- Developed in an agile environment with weekly sprints.

### I've learned to use the following for full stack development:<br/>
